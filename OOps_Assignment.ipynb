        "Polymorphism in Python, especially with inheritance, primarily works through method overriding. When a method is called on an object, Python's dynamic typing allows the appropriate method implementation to be selected at runtime based on the actual type of the object, not its declared type (if any).\n",
        "For example, if you have a base class Animal with a speak() method, and derived classes Dog and Cat that override speak(), you can have a list of Animal objects (which might contain Dog and Cat instances). When you iterate through the list and call speak() on each object, the correct speak() method (either Dog's, Cat's, or Animal's) will be executed based on the object's actual type. This allows for generic code that operates on a collection of diverse objects."
